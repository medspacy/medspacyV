Left-sided facial pain for 5 weeks.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 38-year-old previously healthy male who presented with left-sided facial pain over the past 5 weeks. The pain was first noticed while washing his face and applying pressure. It is described as shock-like, sharp, and shooting, radiating along the left cheek and temple. Initially, the episodes lasted 1-2 seconds and occurred two to three times per day, sometimes spontaneously. The pain has progressively increased in severity and frequency. Mild progressive left facial weakness developed a few weeks after the initial symptoms.

Physical Examination:
General: Afebrile, normal vital signs.

Neurologic: No abnormalities detected.
Other Systems: No abnormalities detected.

Laboratory Findings:
Complete blood count: Normal
Metabolic panel with electrolytes: Normal
Kidney and liver function tests: Normal
C-reactive protein: Normal

Imaging:
Initial MRI of the temporal bones performed at an outside hospital.
Follow-up MRI and CT performed approximately 3 months after initial imaging (Figs 1-4).

Assessment:
The clinical presentation and examination findings are consistent with trigeminal neuralgia.

Plan:
Start treatment with carbamazepine for trigeminal neuralgia. The patient has shown modest improvement in symptoms.
Continue follow-up with neurologic and otolaryngologic evaluations.
Review imaging results and adjust treatment plan as necessary.
