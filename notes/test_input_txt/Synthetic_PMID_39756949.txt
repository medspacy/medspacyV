Patient: Jane Foster
Age: 53
Gender: Female

Preoperative Diagnosis:
Classical trigeminal neuralgia affecting the maxillary division of the right trigeminal nerve.

Postoperative Diagnosis:
Same

Procedure:
Retrosigmoid craniotomy with drilling of the suprameatal tubercle and transposition of compressed vein.

Surgeon: Dr. Ian McDrill, MD

Assistant: Emily Johnson, MBA

Anesthesia: General anesthesia

Indications:
The patient presented with classical trigeminal neuralgia affecting the maxillary division of the right trigeminal nerve. MRI and CT revealed a bony prominence, the suprameatal tubercle, above the opening of the internal acoustic meatus. MRI showed a thick venous flow void interposed between the suprameatal tubercle and trigeminal nerve.

Procedure Details:
1. The patient was placed in the supine position with the head turned to the left.
2. A retrosigmoid craniotomy was performed to access the trigeminal nerve.
3. Upon exposure, the suprameatal tubercle was identified as restricting the transposition of the compressed vein.
4. The bony prominence was drilled to allow for the transposition of the vein.
5. The compressed vein was successfully transposed after drilling the prominence.
6. Hemostasis was achieved, and the surgical site was closed in layers.

Findings:
The suprameatal tubercle was restricting the transposition of the compressed vein. Drilling the prominence allowed for successful transposition of the vein.

Complications:
None

Postoperative Condition:
The patient's symptoms resolved completely following the procedure.

Recommendations:
- Monitor for any signs of recurrence of trigeminal neuralgia.
- Follow-up in 1 month for postoperative evaluation.
